    <h1>Everlasting interest into technology</h1>
    <p>One day 15 years or so ago my dad brought a HUUUGE box to our house. I was wondering is it a washing machine? A TV? But no, it was something different, as much as it sounds like a joke it was something that will define me. Not so much long after I became the local "kid who's good with comput<b>o</b>rs.</p>
    <p>Living my life with the computer got to a whole new level when I finally got a decent Intenret connection and I was able to start <span class="rainbow">learning</span>.</p>

        <h1>Self improvement trough coding</h1>
        <p>At first I wasn't that interested into coding as much as I was interested into media. I learned to use PhotoShop and After Effects trough the Internet and I for some times I worked for a domestic YouTuber as an editor. When it came time to choose what college to enroll I chose something that is not IT oriented because I thought that if I wanted to do IT I'd just learn it online.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Because of school and life I was unable to improve myself in field of IT, but two years ago I decided that I'd like to start learning to code. I decided that webdev would be fun and hit the Internet in pursuit of knowledge. Sadly, again because of life and this time work I had on and off study sessions. I was advancing really slow and eventually gave up because I wanted to be able to spare more time for coding. Also there was an issue that I didn't know how to use my knowledge.</p>
        <p>Even though I gave up I knew that eventually I'll be sure to do this. One day.</p>
